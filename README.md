## Assignment 3 - Setting up with Mapbox
Created a simple clickable map of the stations of the Staten Island Railway leveraging Mapbox. The Map was made show the whole of Staten Island when landing on the page. The stations were generated from data in a JavaScript array and represented with a simple pin. Clicking on a pin displayed a station name and clicking anywhere else closed it. This served as the basis for future assignments.
## Assignment 4 - Adding new features
Added more information to the map in the form of a population density chloropleth. A hazy border was added around the map to focus user attention. Experimentation with some of the bells-and-whistles, namely using images in place of the default MapBox markers and adding a favicon.
## Final Project - Adding interactivity and telling a story
Added buttons to click through and display new test and map features to tell the story of proposing a new Staten Island Railway spur in the South of the Island to New Jersey over Outerbridge. These interactions include map clicking, state changes, and small animations.
